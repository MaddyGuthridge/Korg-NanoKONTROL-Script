# Korg-NanoKONTROL-Script
A Python script which allows FL Studio to communicate with the MIDI Controller Korg NanoKONTROL.

# IMPORTANT

All the functionality of this script has been superceded by my [Universal Controller Script](https://github.com/MiguelGuthridge/Universal-Controller-Script). 
Consider using that instead for a less-janky experience.
