Korg nanoKONTROL User Script for FL Studio
Created by: Miguel Guthridge [hdsq@outlook.com.au]
V 1.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTRO
FL Studio's built-in control script for the Korg NanoKontrol doesn't work for my controller, so I decided to make my own one!
I get the feeling that this script is far more advanced than the existing one would have been anyway. Here are some of the more powerful uses:
 - Browser control: preview samples and navigate the browser
 - Usage-sensitive controls: controls have different actions depending on the active window
 - Parameter snapping: if a parameter is moved near the default value, it will snap to it

------------------------------------------------------------------------

BASIC USAGE
 - Play: play/pause
 - Stop: stop (double press stops all sound?)
 - Skip (forward/backwards): fast-forward/rewind
 - Record: arm/disarm recording
 - Loop: switch loop mode (pattern/song)

LONG PRESSES
Pressing and holding a button for 0.5 seconds can trigger alternate actions.
 - Stop: Escape (close current window)

LOOP MODIFIERS
Pressing a button while the loop button is held overrides window-specific usage and causes the default actions to occur.

WINDOW-SPECIFIC USAGE
In some windows, buttons trigger alternate actions relative to the functions in that window. These override the basic controls.

	BROWSER
	 - Play: Play selected sample, or expand selected folder
	 - Stop: Collapse selected folder
	 - Skip (forwards/backwards): Select next/previous file

	PLAYLIST
	 - Skip (forwards/backwards): Jump to next/previous marker (if no markers exist, the default action is taken)

	MIXER
	 - Skip (forwards/backwards): Selects the next/previous track
	 - Record: Arms/Disarms current track for recording
	 - Button #9 (upper): Solos the selected track
	 - Button #9 (lower): Mutes the selected track
	 - Fader #9: Sets the volume of the selected track
	 - Knob #9: Sets the pan of the selected track
	 - Buttons #1-8 (upper): Solos tracks 1-8 respectively
	 - Buttons #1-8 (lower): Mutes tracks 1-8 respectively
	 - Faders #1-8: Sets the volume for tracks 1-8 respectively
	 - Knobs #1-8: Sets the panning for tracks 1-8 respectively

	CHANNEL RACK
	 - Skip (forwards/backwards): Selects the next/previous channel
	 - Button #9 (upper): Solos the selected channel
	 - Button #9 (lower): Mutes the selected channel
	 - Fader #9: Sets the volume of the selected channel
	 - Knob #9: Sets the panning of the selected channel

ADVANCED
A few features can be modified by changing constants in the script.
 - LONG_PRESS_TIME indicates how long a key needs to be held for for a long press
 - ENABLE_SNAPPING indicates whether knobs and faders will snap to default values
 - SNAP_RANGE indicates how close a knob needs to be to the default value in order to snap
 - Mixer and Channel rack snap values indicate what values to snap to for different variables

------------------------------------------------------------------------

KNOWN ISSUES
 - Actions don't produce the listed outcome: Perform a reset of your controller. Refer to your user guide for instructions. If this doesn't help, send me a bug report (see below)
 - Using Knob 3 while in scene 1 mutes all tracks except track 1: The MIDI event for Scene 4 upper button 1 and Scene 1 knob 3 is the same, so therefore it is impossible to fix this issue. I suggest performing these actions in scene 2 or 3, at least until I figure out how to update the controller's internal state to match the active FL Studio Window
 - Using Knob 4 while in scene 1 mutes track 1: See above.

DEBUGGING
If you encounter some unexpected behaviour, please contact me (my email is above). Make sure you include the following info:
 - What you did
 - What you expected to happen
 - What actually happened
 - What scene mode your controller was on (1-4)
 - A copy of the controller's script output

------------------------------------------------------------------------

PLANS FOR FUTURE BUILDS (If I have time)
 - Use Upper Buttons #1-8 to enable and disable grid bits in selected channel, using some lower buttons to navigate between sections. Display status of grid bits using LED indicators.
 - Light up LEDs to indicate tracks that are muted/solo'd. I don't know if this is possible (if someone has a programming guide for this controller please tell me!)
 - Configure scene button and scene indicators so that they control FL Studio's active window (mixer, playlist, etc). I had this working a little bit but it broke too easily - once again a programming guide would be nice.
 - More long press functions
 - Allow usage in popup windows to control the UI (selecting yes/no, etc)
 - Use a loop modifier in the mixer to change stereo width using the knobs (already implemented, just need a function)

FAQ
 - Can I use parts of this script in other scripts for my own controllers?
	Go ahead! I put too much effort into this for it to be only used for one controller
 - Is this guaranteed to work?
	Hahahaha nope! I mean, it works for me, but my device could be wack lol.
